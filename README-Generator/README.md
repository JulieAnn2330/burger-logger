<h3 id='description'>Description of Project</h3>
<p>In this project the user is experiencing a restaurant app. Through the app they can order, devour and trash the burgers all with the click of a button. This project was homework for the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. This project allows the user to see orders that have been placed, burgers that have been eaten and clear the historical devoured data, if desired. I learned a lot about ORM from this project. It was very challenging building this from the ground up with such an in-depth file structure. I made some very rookie mistakes in developing this, including forgetting to import my javascript file into my main.handlebars guide, which causes everything to not work, and then putting the jquery file ahead of the javascript file, which again, causes things to not work. I tried to knock this all out in a short amount of time without a break, one, becuase I enjoyed what I was doing, but also because I just wanted to finish it. On the advice of my instructor I let it sit overnight and came back to it with fresh eyes. Best. Advice. Ever. I think the styling of the homepage including the custom logo, font used and colors make this project stand out. </p><br>
