<h3 id='description'>Description of Project</h3>
<p>This app allows a user to create and delete notes in real time. It also displays all notes down the left side of the page for a comprehensive view. This project was homework for the University of Kansas BootCamp. This project is great for busy people who are looking for a convenient way to create and store notes. I learned a lot of things about this project that were not taught or even referenced in class from outside sources, specifically Traversy Media's Express Crash Course and google for deploying projects with Heroku. I feel that more time should have been spent in class discussing file structure and naming conventions in order for this project to have been suceessful quicker. I completely destructed the file structure that was given to us for two reasons: 1. The sever.js folder had to be in the root folder in order to deploy to Heroku, based on errors I was getting and answers I found on Google. 2. Once I moved the server.js folder to the root folder, my notes page would not display properly. I came to the assumption that for it run it needed to be in the same folder as the db and public files. Once I moved everything out of the Develop folder that was provided to us, I was able to run the app correctly and deploy to Heroku.  My project stands out due to the unique id I am assigning using a uuid generator. I found out about this through the Traversy tutorial. My project features a generated unique id using the uuid module and has the ability to create, save, view and delete notes. One feature that I would like to add is the ability to update notes, but I haven't figured that out yet.</p><br>
